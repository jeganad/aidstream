        "en": "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assigns companies an Employer Identification Number (EIN) upon application. However, not all corporate entities are required to have an EIN. For tax-exempt entities (non-profits, charities etc.) the IRS maintains a list of EINs. Public listed company EINs are available via the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \n\nOther EINs may be available by asking the organisation concerned, and are sometimes published on their websites.\n\n\"An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. Generally, businesses need an EIN. \" [1]\n\n\"An employer identification number (EIN), also called a tax ID number or taxpayer ID, is required for most business entities... A tax ID number is not required if you operate a sole proprietorship or an LLC with no employees, in which case you would simply use your own Social Security Number as a tax ID.\" [2]\n\n\"In the US, corporate registration happens at the state level. The timeliness, availability, and licensing of this data varies among all 50 states. There is no federal dataset that contains all corporate registrations. It would be possible to create a unified open registry for all US corporations (even if only via aggregation from state ones) but this does not exist at this time.\n\nAcross those states performance varies widely and in many cases data is not available in bulk, is not machine readable, is not openly licensed etc. For more detail, see the per state summary on Open Corporates.\" [3]\n\n\"The Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. When the number is used for identification rather than employment tax reporting, it is usually referred to as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and when used for the purposes of reporting employment taxes, it is usually referred to as an EIN.

Infogreffe provide a basic overview of company information for free, and bulk download of data for a fee.\n\nA note on identifiers: \n\n- A SIRET number is constituted by the SIREN number, plus the NIC code. \n\n- The SIREN number relates to a business, whereas a SIRET number relates to a specific geographically located establishment which will be owned by a business.\n\n- \"A SIREN number is your unique French business identification number. This 9 digit number will be requested by all French administration when dealing with you.. It is a proof that you are a fully registered French business\" [1]\n\n\"The SIRET code/number is an INSEE code which allows the geographic identification of any French establishment or business.\n\nThe 14-digit number consists of three parts:\n\n- first, the SIREN code of the business (or legal unit or person) that owns the unit represented by the SIRET code,\n- second, the NIC (French: Num\u00e9ro interne de classement), is a sequential four-digit number unique to the establishment,\n- and finally, a check digit that verifies the entire SIRET number.\n\nFor example, 732 829 320 00074 would refer to the seventh establishment of the business with SIREN number 732 829 320.\" [2]\n\n\"Registration is administered by local centres de formalit\u00e9s des entreprises ( CFE), which checks your application and submits details to the relevant agencies (for a small fee).

        "en": "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) maintain a list of organisations whom are involved in the transfer of 'Official Development Assistance' (ODA) financial flows. This list provides a useful fall-back source of identification for government agencies and multilateral organisations involved in aid, and in some cases, for international NGOs. \n\nThe list is updated perioidically in response to demand for new entries from DAC members. \n\nUsers should note that this list is designed to identify both organisations *and* funds or programmes, and so not all entries in this list equate to legally registered organisations. \n\nThe list is available as a spreadsheet containing multiple codelists. Two can be used to construct organisation identifiers.\n\n* The **Agency** list is used to construct identifiers for aid donor and recipient government agencies. This is constructed by combining the **donorcode** and **AgencyCode**, separated with a dash. For example, XM-DAC-1-8 identifies the Austrian (1) Development Agency (8).\n \n* The **Channel codes** list is used to construct identifiers for multilateral organisations, and international NGOs for whom no other identifier is available. The 'Channel ID' should be used. For example, XM-DAC-41301 is the identifier for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). \n\n* The **Donor** list contains donor code values referring to the donor country as a whole. To maximise consistency, donor codes should not be used unless a specific agency, government department or fund is not identified for the reporting. In all other cases codes should be published in their 'Agency' form (e.g. XM-DAC-1-8 for Austrian Development Agency, rather than XM-DAC-1). \n\nUsers should also note that some organisations exist in both the 'Channel Codes' and 'Agency' lists. As the Channel Codes list provides a cross-walk, use of the Channel Codes is preferred in these cases."

To date, BRIDGE numbers for organizations/entities in eight countries have been released as open data: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States. Data for additional countries will be released on an ongoing basis as the BRIDGE team assesses and addresses any potential data privacy and security risks of making this data publicly available.\n\n**The legal form or organizations that the list covers**: BRIDGE covers a variety of entities. Any private organization or program anywhere in the world devoted to social good can be assigned a BRIDGE number. The social sector encompasses the entire ecosystem of institutions that work to advance social good, regardless of organization type. This includes foundations, nonprofit organizations, schools, religious organizations, and companies. In addition, BRIDGE may assign numbers to individual chapters or branches of an organization, to programs (such as corporate giving programs), as well as to funds, which often essentially function as independent organizations. A BRIDGE number can be assigned to any entity, whether active or inactive, valid or fraudulent, new or old. A BRIDGE number itself conveys no information about the validity, veracity, quality, or status of an organization, including its current existence as a viable entity. It only serves to disambiguate and uniquely define records. BRIDGE does not assign numbers to individuals.\n\n"
