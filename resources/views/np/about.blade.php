            <p>
                AidStream Nepal is a platform developed to meet the transparency needs of CSOs, development partners, government and wider stakeholders in Nepal. It aims to empower civil society organizations working in Nepal by making <a href="http://iatistandard.org/">IATI</a> more accessible to them. Together, we want to make aid data open and transparent, and ultimately, use that data to improve aid outcomes in Nepal.

                        Aidstream Nepal is brought to you by <a href="http://www.yipl.com.np/">YoungInnovations</a>, with support from local organizations and partners in Nepal. It has been developed as an Open Source product, and is also available in <a href="https://github.com/younginnovations/aidstream-tz/">GitHub</a>. The platform has been forked from the existing global AidStream platform which is already a go-to place for global actors to publish data into IATI.  Please feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@aidstream.org">support@aidstream.org</a> if you want to contribute to this open source development.
